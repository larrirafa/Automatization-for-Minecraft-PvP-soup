Minecraft Automatic Recraft System

Automation developed to perform automatic recraft inside Minecraft, specifically in a PvP game mode where soups are used for health regeneration.

The system executes the recraft process — the act of quickly crafting soups when opening the inventory — automatically, optimizing player response time and increasing combat efficiency.

This automation provides:

Instant soup crafting

Greater agility during PvP fights

Reduced manual errors during recraft

Improved competitive performance


Resolution Compatibility & Customization

The automation is designed to work with a 1920x1080 resolution.

If adjustments are needed, a complementary file is included to help modify the exact pixel positions where the mouse performs clicks.

File: ScreenPosition.py

This allows the user to easily adapt the automation to different screen resolutions or custom interface layouts.
